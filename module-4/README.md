# Collaborating with GitHub

## Module 4

### Introduction

GitHub hosts code written by some of the most intelligent software developers of our time, some of the most important projects that have ever been made. Tensorflow, the machine learning library that has made artificial intelligence accessible to the world, Bootstrap, the front end framework that brings web development into the mobile first era, and Node.js, the library that brings the power of Javascript to the server, making web development in the age of MASSIVE DATA more accessible. These projects and more are hosted on GitHub. However, these feats of modern software are not individual projects, they are collaborative efforts made prolific by the involvement of a _global community_ of developers. A community that wants YOU to join!
